# **App Name**: GyateGyate Platform

## Core Features:

- Lootbox Purchase: Allow players to purchase lootboxes using SUI or GYATE tokens.
- NFT Minting: Mint GyateGyate NFTs with varying rarities and variants based on on-chain randomness. Apply rarity based on probabilities outlined in the code.
- NFT Display: Display minted NFTs with associated metadata (name, rarity, variant, stats) in a user-friendly interface.
- Marketplace Listing: Enable players to list their GyateGyate NFTs on the marketplace for a set price.
- Marketplace Purchase: Allow players to purchase listed NFTs, with a 10% fee automatically directed to the TreasuryPool.
- Pity System: Implement a pity system where players are guaranteed higher rarity NFTs after a certain number of lootbox openings. This will use UserProgress and roll probabilities accordingly.
- Name Suggestion: AI tool to help users suggest cool name for their NFT before putting in the Kiosk for sell. If the user has no inspiration for the name, use the AI to come up with a name that matches the characteristics of the image

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep purple (#673AB7), evocative of mystery, value, and collectibility, creating a high-end feel.
- Background color: Dark gray (#303030), a dark scheme providing contrast to make interactive elements 'pop'.
- Accent color: Electric violet (#8A2BE2) to highlight interactive elements, like buttons and calls to action, with brightness and contrast.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', a futuristic sans-serif to give a computerized, scientific feel; and 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif as body text to keep with modern look and feel.
- Use clear, outlined icons for UI elements, with the electric violet (#8A2BE2) accent color to indicate interactivity and status.
- Maintain a clean, grid-based layout, with ample whitespace to improve readability and reduce visual clutter. Utilize full-screen hero sections for key landing pages.
- Incorporate subtle animations and transitions for UI elements to provide a smooth and engaging user experience. Animate NFT reveals with dynamic effects.
